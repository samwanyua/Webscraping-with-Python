# Data Scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project involves scraping data from a Wikipedia page and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the largest companies in the United States by revenue.

## Overview

The project consists of two main parts:
1. **Data Scraping:** Extracting data from [Wikipedia: List of largest companies in the United States by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting various analyses to understand patterns and trends in the data.


## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Beautiful Soup**: For web scraping
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis

## Data Scraping

The data was scraped using Beautiful Soup and Requests. The target website was the [Wikipedia page on the largest companies in the United States by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue).

### Steps:
1. **Extracted the table data** containing company information such as Rank, Name, Industry, Revenue, Revenue growth, Employees, and Headquarters.
2. **Saved the data** to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to gain insights into the dataset, including:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarized the numerical features to get an overview.
2. **Distribution Analysis:** Plotted histograms to identify patterns and outliers.
3. **Categorical Analysis:** Visualized the distribution of companies across different industries.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Explored relationships between numerical features.
5. **Outlier Detection:** Used box plots to identify unusual data points.

## Visualizations

A variety of plots were created to illustrate key insights:
- Histograms for distribution analysis
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Correlation heatmap to show relationships between features
